# Personal Portfolio GitHub Pages Website

This is the repository that hosts my personal portfolio website. You can find the hosted site [here](https://trevrawr.github.io/). 
Note: this repository only contains the deploy-ready output files
from the tools I used to build the site. The actual source code for the site can be found at 
[this repository](https://github.com/TrevRawr/Personal-Portfolio-Website).

The reason there are two separate repositories for hosting and storing the source code for this site is because GitHub Pages does not allow
you to set the source folder (which stores the files to host) to any folder except the root repository folder on the master branch. You
CAN change this for "Project" GitHub Pages sites, but you're not allowed for "User or Organization" GitHub Pages sites. This site is a 
User site. For more info on types of GitHub Pages, [check this out](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)
Don't ask me why GitHub decided to do things this way!
