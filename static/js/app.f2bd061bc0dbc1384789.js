This was my first experience with graphics\n          programming. It was an extremely difficult course, but I loved every minute of it. The course had 4 assignments, which were cumulative.\n          In the first assignment, we built line and polygon renderers\n          that simply drew 2-D lines and polygons of a given color on the screen. In the next assignment, we started drawing 3-dimensional primitives by implementing\n          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilinear_interpolation">bi-linear interpolation</a> of colors across our polygon renderer, and using\n          <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/graphics/depth-cueing-r861/">Depth Cueing/Shading</a> to draw parts of polygons that\n          were farther away as a darker color. At this point, the 3-D effect was pretty crude looking since there was no proper lighting implemented,\n          and no perspective (where things farther away get smaller). In the next assignment, we implemented perspective, parsing/rendering a\n          subset of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wavefront_.obj_file">.obj 3-D model files</a> (still no lighting), and a moveable "camera"\n          so that the user could look at models from different angles in the\n          3-D world.

What sets this\n          application apart from a standard generic buy/sell website (think Craigslist) is that each ad is associated with a textbook from our database.\n          Each textbook is uniquely identified by an ISBN number, so this allows ads to be filtered unambiguously by the exact textbook for sale rather than\n          a keyword-based search approach (like Craigslist), which may turn up results for similar undesired textbooks (ex: a textbook of the same name, but different edition).\n          Another nice feature of this app is that the database of textbooks is self-maintaining. If a textbook with a given ISBN doesn't exist, the first person to make an ad for that textbook\n          will have to create a new textbook entry in the database. This means the database will naturally grow over time.\n          Textbook database entries have publicly editable wiki pages, this ensures that the community can correct any data entry errors, and maintain the most accurate information for a given textbook.\n          Since all ads for a given textbook are associated with the same textbook instance, if a person edits the textbook wiki page for one textbook, all the ads for that textbook will be updated.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          In this course,\n          the main focus of the course material was on building a backend web server to support a web app. Less emphasis was put on the front end\n          HTML/CSS/Javascript side of things. As a result, the majority of this app's logic takes place on the back end server. The back end serves\n          dynamically generated, (mostly) static html pages. We still used some Javascript for sections of the app that required more user interaction.\n          From what I've gathered, modern web development seems to be heading away from this multi-paged, static content approach, and is moving\n          towards single page applications driven by Javascript libraries and AJAX requests to load more data into pages without reloading the page.\n          In hindsight, this would have probably been the best way to implement this application, but the multi-paged approach we used worked well enough\n          for the scope of this course project.\n
